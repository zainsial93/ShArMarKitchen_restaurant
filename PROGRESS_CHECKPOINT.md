# ✅ Progress Checkpoint - Sial Foodies

**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Status:** 🐞 BUG FIX (Connection Error)

---

### 🚨 Issue Found:
The website was trying to connect to `localhost:5000` (your computer) instead of the Railway server.

### 🛠️ Fix Applied:
Updated `AdminLogin.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, and `AdminDashboard.jsx` to use the correct `API_URL` from Vercel settings.

### 📝 Next Steps (Redeploy):
1.  **Commit & Push** your changes to GitHub.
2.  **Vercel** will automatically detect the change and redeploy.
3.  Once done, refresh your website and try Login again.
